# ATmega328-to-ESP8266-to-Firebase-data-base-to-web-app
As ATmega328 lacks the WIFI interface to be able log data to web server, this project utilizes ESP8266 variability,. to interface with Firebase real time data base datalogging. Data received from sensor is put in single string, then when received by ESP8266 via software serial the data is recognised and separated for furthur transmition to Firebase real time data base. Once logged, the web app servs as display interface where user can moninor dat anywhere in worled, once access to internet
